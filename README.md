flare-hdcore
============

High Definition mod for Flare fantasycore

Flare 1.0 comes with a fantasycore mod that is set at a base 640x480 resolution. There is also minicore which reduces it by half, 320x240 resolution for mobile devices.

This optional mod called "hdcore" uses 1280x960 resolution, double the fantasycore size. It only overwrites the images and related settings of fantasycore, thus still requiring fantasycore for most game data.
